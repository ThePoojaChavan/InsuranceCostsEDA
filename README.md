# InsuranceCostsEDA

Dataset was first cleaned in Power query and then EDA (Descriptive statisctics, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Pivot Tables/Charts) was performed in Excel

The business question we tried to find an answer to:
What factors affect the insurance costs? Is it gender, BMI, region, whethet you are a smoker , whethet you have 0-5 kids or your age?

Note: Dataset includes data from USA only.
